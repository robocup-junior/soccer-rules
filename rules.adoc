[title="Two teams of two robots with an orange ball on a RoboCupJunior Soccer field."]
image::media/field_with_two_teams.jpg[RCJASoccer, 288, 210]

[discrete]
== Preface

In the RoboCupJunior Soccer challenge, teams of young engineers design, build,
and program two fully autonomous mobile robots to compete against another team
in matches. The robots must detect a ball and score into a color-coded goal on
a special field that resembles a human soccer field.

To be successful, participants must demonstrate skill in programming, robotics,
electronics and mechatronics. Teams are also expected to contribute to the
advancement of the community as a whole by sharing their discoveries with other
participants and by engaging in good sportsmanship, regardless of culture, age
or result in the competition. *All are expected to compete, learn, have fun, and grow.*

RoboCupJunior Soccer consist of two sub-leagues: *Soccer Open* and *Soccer
Lightweight*. These rules apply for both sub-leagues. There are two main
differences between the two leagues.

* *Soccer Lightweight* is played using a special ball that emits an IR
signal. Robots may weigh up to 1.4 kg, may have a ball-capturing zone of
up to 3.0 cm.

* *Soccer Open* is played using a passive, brightly colored orange golf
ball. Robots have no weight restriction and may have a ball-capturing zone of up to
1.5 cm.

IMPORTANT: A large part of the overall ranking (for the international tournament,
other tournaments operate differently) is determined by the judged
categories. There are points for documentation, inteview performance etc.
The method for calculation of the overall scores will be published on the
RoboCupJunior Soccer Website at a later date but before the international
competition. footnote:[

=== Changes from the 2024 RoboCupJunior Soccer Rules

// TODO: Summarize changes here
// The rule changes developed by the Soccer League Committee in cooperation with the
// RoboCup Junior Soccer Community (please continue to post ideas for the future on
// the forum any time) aim to improve gameplay.

Detailed changes are listed below and link to the corresponding place in the rules.

{+-~TOC-CHANGES~-+}

[[gameplay]]
== GAMEPLAY

[[game-procedure-and-length-of-a-game]]
=== Game procedure and length of a game

RCJ Soccer games consist of two teams of robots playing soccer against each
other. Each team has two autonomous robots. The game will consist of two
halves. The duration of each half is 10-minutes. There will be a 5-minute break
in between the halves.

Teams are expected to be at the field 5 minutes before their game starts. Being
at the inspection table does not count in favor of this time limit. Teams that
are late for the start of the game may be penalized one goal *per 30 seconds*
at the referee’s discretion.

The final game score will be trimmed so that there is at most 10-goal
difference between the losing and the winning team.

[[pre-match-meeting]]
=== Pre-match meeting

At the start of the first half of the game, a referee will toss a coin. The
team mentioned first in the draw shall call the coin. The winner of the toss
can choose either which end to kick towards, or to kick off first. The loser of
the toss chooses the other option. After the first half, teams switch sides.
The team not kicking off in the first half of the game will kick off to begin
the second half of the game.

During the pre-match meeting the referee(s) may check whether
the robots are capable of playing (i.e., whether they are at least able to
follow and react to the ball). If none of the robots is capable of playing, the
game will not be played and zero goals will be awarded to both teams.

[[kick-off]]
=== Kick-off

Each half of the game begins with a kick-off. All robots must be located on
their own side of the field. All robots must be halted. The ball is positioned
by a referee in the center of the field.

The team kicking off places their robots on the field first.

The team not kicking off will now place their robots on the defensive end of
the field. All robots on the team not kicking off must be at least 30 cm away
from the ball (outside of the center circle).

Robots cannot be placed out of bounds. Robots cannot be repositioned once they
have been placed, except if the referee requests to adjust their placement to
make sure that the robots are placed properly within the field positions.

On the referee’s command (usually by whistle), all robots will be started
immediately. Any robots that are started early will be removed
by the referee from the field and deemed damaged.

Before a kick-off, *all damaged or out-of-bounds robots* are allowed to return to
the playing field immediately if they are _ready and fully functional_.

If no robots are present at a kick-off (because they have moved out-of-bounds
<<out-of-bounds>> or are damaged <<damaged-robots>>), the penalties are
discarded and the match resumes with a <<neutral-kickoff>>.

[[neutral-kickoff]]
==== Neutral kick-off

A neutral kick-off is the same as the one described in <<kick-off>> with a
small change: all robots must be at least 30 cm away from the ball
(outside of the center circle).

[[scoring]]
=== Scoring

A goal is scored when the ball strikes or touches the back wall of the goal.
Goals scored by any robot have the same end result: they give one goal to the
team on the opposite side. After a goal, the game will be restarted with a
kick-off from the team who was scored against.

[[ball-movement]]
=== Ball movement

A robot cannot hold a ball. Holding a ball is defined as taking full control of
the ball by removing all of degrees of freedom. Examples for ball holding
include fixing a ball to the robot’s body, surrounding a ball using the robot’s
body to prevent access by others, encircling the ball or somehow trapping the
ball with any part of the robot’s body. If a ball does not roll while a robot
is moving, it is a good indication that the ball is trapped.

The only exception to holding is the use of a rotating drum (a "dribbler") that
imparts dynamic back spin on the ball to keep the ball on its surface.

Other players must be able to access the ball.

The ball needs to stay within the bounds of the field, as defined by the
walls. If a robot moves the ball outside of the field (that is, beyond the walls
or above their height), it is deemed damaged. (<<damaged-robots>>)

Any robot must approach and touch the ball when it is placed on the nearest
neutral spot. It must do this before lack of progress is called. When on its
own side of the field, any robot must be able to move the ball from the nearest
neutral spot to the opponent's side of the field. If a specific robot does not act
this way, referees may deem it damaged at their discretion.
(See <<damaged-robots, Damaged Robots>>.) This rule does not apply if the robot
is hindered from detecting or playing the ball by the opponent.

[[inside-penalty-area]]
=== Inside the Penalty Area

No robots are allowed to be fully inside the penalty area. As the penalty
areas are marked with a white line, the Out of Bounds rule
applies. (<<out-of-bounds>>)

If two robots from the same team are at least partially in a penalty area,
the robot further from the ball will be moved to the _furthest unoccupied
neutral spot_ immediately. If this happens repeatedly, a robot may be deemed
damaged at referee's discretion. (<<damaged-robots>>)

If an attacking and a defending robot touch each other while at least one of
them is at least partially inside the penalty area, and at least one of them
has physical contact with the ball, this may be called "pushing" at the
referee's discretion. In this case, the ball will be moved to the _furthest
unoccupied neutral spot_ immediately.

If a goal is scored as a result of a "pushing" situation, it will not be
granted.

[[lack-of-progress]]
=== Lack of progress

Lack of progress occurs if there is no progress in the gameplay for a
reasonable period of time and the situation is not likely to change. Typical
lack of progress situations are when the ball is stuck between robots, when
there is no change in ball and robot’s positions, or when the ball is beyond
detection or reach capability of all robots on the field.

After a visible and loud count footnote:[usually a count of three],
a referee will call `*lack of progress*` and
will move the ball to the nearest unoccupied neutral spot. If this does not
solve the lack of progress, the referee can move the ball to a different
neutral spot.

[[out-of-bounds]]
=== Out of bounds

If a robot touches a wall or moves completely into the penalty area it
will be called for being `*out of bounds*`. When this situation arises, the
robot is removed from the field for a one-minute penalty. 
There is no time stoppage for the game itself. The robot is
allowed to return if a kick-off occurs before the penalty has elapsed.

The one-minute penalty starts when the robot is removed from play.
Furthermore, any goal scored by the penalized team while the penalized robot is
on the field will not be granted. Out-of-bounds robots can be fixed if the team
needs to do so, as described in <<damaged-robots>>.

After the penalty time has passed, robot will be placed on the unoccupied
neutral spot furthest from the ball, facing its own goal.

A referee can waive the penalty if the robot was accidentally pushed out of
bounds by an opposing robot. In such a case, the referee may have to slightly
push the robot back onto the field.

[[damaged-robots]]
=== Damaged robots

If a robot is damaged, it has to be taken off the field and must be fixed
before it can play again. Even if repaired, the robot must remain off the field
for at least one minute or until the next kick-off is due.

Some examples of a damaged robot include:

* it does not respond to the ball, or is unable to move (it lost pieces,
power, etc.).
* it continually moves into the penalty area or out of bounds.
* it turns over on its own accord.

After a robot has been fixed, it will be placed on the unoccupied neutral spot
furthest from the ball, facing its own goal.

*Only the referee decides whether a robot is damaged.* A robot can only be
taken off or returned with the referee’s permission.

If both robots from the same team are deemed damaged at kick-off, gameplay will
be paused and the remaining team will be awarded 1 goal for each elapsed 30
seconds that their opponent’s robots remain damaged. However, these rules only
apply when none of the two robots from the same team were damaged as the result
of the opponent team violating the rules.

Whenever a robot is removed from play, its motors must be turned off.


[[human-interference]]
=== Human interference

Except for the kick-off, human interference from the teams (e.g. touching the
robots) during the game is not allowed unless explicitly permitted by a
referee. Violating team(s)/team member(s) may be disqualified from the game.

The referee(s) can help robots get unstuck if the ball is
not being disputed near them and if the situation was created from normal
interaction between robots (i.e. it was not a design or programming flaw of the
robot alone). The referee(s) will pull back the robots just
enough for them to be able to move freely again.

[[interruption-of-game-ref-interruption]]
=== Interruption of Game

In principle, a game will not be stopped.

A referee can stop the game if there is a situation on or around the field
which the referee wants to discuss with an official of the tournament or if the
ball malfunctions and a replacement is not readily available.

When the referee has stopped the game, all robots must be stopped and remain on
the field untouched. The referee may decide whether the game will be
continued/resumed from the situation in which the game was stopped or by a
neutral kick-off.

[[robots]]
== ROBOTS

[[robots-interference]]
=== Interference

Robots are not allowed to be colored orange, yellow or blue in order to avoid
interference. Orange, yellow, blue colored parts used in the construction of
the robot must either be occluded by other parts from the perception by other
robots or be taped/painted with a neutral color.

Robots must not produce magnetic interference in other robots on the field.

Robots must not produce visible light that may prevent the opposing team from
playing when placed on a flat surface. Any part of a robot that produces light
that may interfere with the opposing robot’s vision system must be covered.
For Lightweight-specific regulations see <<regulations-inference-in-lightweight>>

Robots are expected to be capable of dealing with any visible colors above the
walls (e.g. blue, yellow, green or orange shirts) either in hardware (e.g. 
limiting the field of view from looking up) or in software (e.g. masking
the input image).

The referee can interrupt a game in progress if any kind of interference from
spectators is suspected (IR emitters, camera flashes, mobile
phones, radios, computers, etc.).

A team claiming that their robot is affected by the other team’s robot in any
way must provide proof or evidence of the interference. Any interference needs to
be confirmed by the tournament organizers if a claim is placed by the other team.

[[robots-control]]
=== Control & Communication

The use of remote control of any kind is not allowed during the match. Robots
must be controlled autonomously.

{++For only the World Championships, starting in Brazil 2025, use of a Communications
Module is required for referees to control the robots. 
See <<international-competition-specifics>>++}

[[agility]]
=== Agility

Robots must be constructed and programmed in a way that their movement is not
limited to only one dimension (defined as a single axis, such as only moving in
a straight line). They must move in all directions, for example by turning.

[[handle]]
=== Handle

All robots must have a stable and easily noticeable handle to hold and to lift
them. The handle must be easily accessible and allow the robot to be picked up
from at least 5 cm above the highest structure of the robot. {++ There must be a
minimum clearance of 5 cm for hands between the highest non-handle part of the
robot and the handle. ++}

The dimensions of the handle may exceed the robot height
limitation, but the part of the handle that exceeds this
limit cannot be used to mount components of the robot.

The weight of the robot includes that of the handle.

[[top-markers]]
=== Top Markers

A robot must have markings in order to be distinguished by the referee. Each
robot must have a white plastic circle with a diameter of at least 4 cm mounted
horizontally on top. This white circle will be used by the referee to write
numbers on the robots using markers, therefore the white circles must be
accessible and visible. The top markers do not need to be within the size
limit of the robot.

Before the game, the referee will designate the numbers for each robot and will
write them on the top white circle. Robots not carrying the top white circle
are not eligible to play.

[[violations]]
=== Violations

Robots that do not abide by the specifications/regulations (see
<<regulations>>) are not allowed to play, unless these rules specify otherwise.

If violations are detected during a running game the team may be disqualified for
that game.

If similar violations occur repeatedly, the team may be disqualified from the
tournament.

[[specifications]]
=== Material specifications

Detailed specifications of the ball and fields can be found in the footnote
footnote:[
https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/field_specification.pdf
or https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/field_specification.html 
and https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/ball_specification.pdf
or https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/ball_specification.html respectively].

[[lightweight-ball-change]]
=== Soccer Lightweight Ball change 2026

{++Starting in 2026, Lightweight Soccer will be moving to a new IR Ball. The key
difference with this ball is the size change from 74mm to 42mm diameter,
which is the same size as the Open League's passive ball. More information
will be released during the 2025 season by the Committee. This ball is
Open-Source, so anyone can produce one from the files & instructions on the
GitHub Page here: https://github.com/robocup-junior/ir-golf-ball . Entry
Leagues will continue to use the large infrared ball.++}
footnote:[Entry Leagues frequently use Lego, FischerTechnik, Vex or other
robotics kits with which handling a small ball is more difficult, especially
for beginners.]

[[tournament-balls]]
=== Tournament balls

Balls for the tournament must be made available by the tournament organizers.
Tournament organizers are not responsible for providing balls for practice.

[[code-of-conduct]]
== CODE OF CONDUCT

[[fair-play]]
=== Fair Play

It is expected that the aim of all teams is to play a fair and clean game of
robot soccer. It is expected that all robots will be built with consideration
to other participants.

Robots are not allowed to cause deliberate interference with or damage to other
robots during normal gameplay.

Robots are not allowed to cause damage to the field or to the ball during
normal gameplay.

A robot that causes damage may be disqualified from a specific match at the
tournament organizer's discretion.

Humans are not allowed to cause deliberate interference with robots or damage
to the field or the ball.

[[conflict-resolution]]
== CONFLICT RESOLUTION

[[referees]]
=== Referees

The referee(s) are in charge of making decisions with regards to the game,
according to these rules.

*During gameplay, the decisions made by the referee(s) are final.*

Only the team member(s) at the table have a mandate to freely speak to the referee(s).

At the conclusion of the game the results become final with signatures from
both teams. Disputes need to be settled before signing.

[[rule-clarification]]
=== Rule clarification

Rule clarification may be made by members of the tournament organizers
and the Soccer League Committee, if necessary even during a tournament.

[[rule-modification]]
=== Rule modification

If special circumstances, such as unforeseen problems or capabilities of a
robot occur, rules may be modified by the tournament organizers, if
necessary even during a tournament.

[[competition-specifics]]
=== Competition specifics

Each competition (from local to international) may have adapted rules and
added specifics (scoring, interviews, tournament modes, rule variations
etc.). Check with organizers of each tournament you participate in.

[[league-regulations]]
== LEAGUE REGULATIONS

[[league-regulations-preamble]]
=== Preamble

For RoboCupJunior , there are two sub-leagues as follows

* Soccer Lightweight
* Soccer Open

The matches in the Soccer Open
sub-league are conducted using a passive ball, whereas the matches in the
Soccer Lightweight sub-league are played using the IR ball.
footnote:[ for detailled ball specifications see: <<specifications>>]

[[regulations]]
=== Regulations

[[dimensions]]
==== Dimensions

Robots will be measured in an upright position with all parts extended. A
robot’s dimensions must not exceed the following limits:

|===
|sub-league | *Soccer* *Open* | *Soccer Lightweight*
|size ^[0]^  | 18.0 cm | 22.0 cm +
|height | 18.0 cm | 22.0 cm +
|weight | {~~2200 g~>No limit~~} | 1400 g +
|ball-capturing zone | 1.5 cm | 3.0 cm +
|===

TIP: [0] Robot must fit smoothly into a cylinder of this diameter

Ball-capturing zone is defined as any internal space created when a straight
edge is placed on the protruding points of a robot. This means the ball must
not enter the convex hull of a robot by more than the specified depth.
Furthermore, it must be possible for another robot to take possession of the
ball.

[[regulations-inference-in-lightweight]]
==== Infrared interference in Lightweight

Components designed
to emit IR (e.g. ToF, LiDAR, IR distance sensors, IR LEDs/LASERs etc.) are not
allowed and tournament organizers will require such devices to be removed or
covered up.

[[regulations-limitations]]
==== Limitations

A robot may use any number of cameras without restrictions on lenses,
optical parts, optical systems, and total field of view. Components may be
sourced in any way the team sees fit.

{--Pneumatic devices are allowed to use ambient air only.--}

Kicker strength is subject to compliance check at any time during the
competition. During gameplay, a referee can ask to see a sample kick on the
field before each half when a damaged robot is returned to the field or when
the game is about to be restarted after a goal. If the referee strongly
suspects that a kicker exceeds the power limit, they can require an official
measurement. See <<kicker-power-measuring>> for more details.

[[regulations-inspections]]
==== Inspections

Robots must be inspected and certified every day before the first game is
played. The tournament organizers may request other inspections if necessary,
including random inspections which may happen at any time.

[[international-competition]]
== INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION

[[international-competition-team]]
=== Team

{~~Soccer Lightweight team members can participate in the World
Championship only twice. After their second participation, they need to move to
Soccer Open.~>This rule has been removed from 2025 onwards.~~}

[[international-competition-specifics]]
=== International Competition Specifics

{++Starting from the 2025 International Competition in Brazil, the Soccer League
Committee will provide each team with a Communication Module. This allow for 
easier co-ordination of games and referee control of robots during matches. Each
team will be expected to interface with this module using a single 2.54mm GPIO
pin at present to start and stop the robots. The Soccer League Committee plans 
on extending this to using UART for more complex applications in future
years. Please see the GitHub page for more information on the module:
https://github.com/robocup-junior/soccer-communication-module

The module itself may exceed the maximum height of the robot. It must
be placed at least 1cm away from the outside and protected from impact
damage.++}

[[interviews]]
=== Interviews

During the international competition, the tournament organizers may arrange to
interview teams during the Setup Day of the event. This means that the teams
need to be already present early on this day.

Details on what is required for and what to expect from interviews can be
found in the scoring document available here footnote:[
https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/scoring.pdf or 
https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/scoring.html].

The Soccer League Committee recommends the implementation of interviews in regional
competitions as well, but this is not mandatory. Teams should check with tournament
organizers if they hold interviews and if so and what kind of interview to expect.

[[technical-challenges]]
=== Technical Challenges

Inspired by the major leagues and the need for further technological
advancement of the leagues, the Soccer League Committee runs what are
called *Technical Challenges*. New challenges are added each year, and
are unknown until during the International Competition.

The idea of these challenges is to give the teams an opportunity to show off
various abilities of their robots which may not get noticed during the regular
games. Furthermore, the Soccer League Committee envisions these challenges to be a
place for testing new ideas that may make it to the future rules, or otherwise
shape the competition.

Any RoboCupJunior Soccer team will be eligible to try to tackle these
challenges.

[[further-information-on-international-competition]]
=== Further information on International Competition

All teams qualified to the international competition *must* share their
designs, both hardware and software, with all present and future participants.
These teams are also required to send a digital portfolio before the
competition. Further details on how will be provided by the Soccer League
Committee which acts as the tournament organizers for the international competition.

During the competition days of the international competition (as well as before
the event) the team members are responsible for checking all relevant
information published by the Soccer League Committee
or any other RoboCup official.

There will also be a SuperTeam competition, in which various teams from around
the world share their robots in one "SuperTeam" and play against other
SuperTeams on a so called "Big Field". Teams could utilise different camera 
lenses or sensors optimised for the larger playing fields to improve their
performance. The full rules of this challenge can be found at
https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/superteam_rules.html or 
https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/superteam_rules.pdf 

Teams competing in the international competition can receive awards for their
performance. These awards are decided and introduced by the Soccer League
Committee, which publishes all necessary details well before the actual event.
In the past years they were awarded for best poster, presentation, robot
design, team spirit and individual games. footnote:[for details see
https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/scoring.pdf or 
https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/scoring.html]

[[entry-league]]
== ENTRY LEAGUE

In order to help newcomers experience the RoboCupJunior Soccer competition, the
Soccer League Committee would like to encourage competitions to include
a so called "Entry League". Although such a league will not be part of the
international competition, the Soccer League Committee still believes that it is
worthwhile to make it part of regional and super-regional competitions. To this end,
the Soccer League Committee has prepared a suggested ruleset. footnote:[Avaliable
as HTML and PDF at
https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules-entry/master/rules.html and
https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules-entry/master/rules.pdf respectively]
Some regional and super-regional competitions already have rulesets and will likely
make changes to the suggested rulesets or replace them entirely for their events.
footnote:[Examples:
https://www.robocupjunior.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RCJASoccer-SimpleSimon2021.pdf,
https://rcj2019.eu/sites/default/files/Soccer%201-1%20Standard%20Kit%20Rules%202019%20Final.pdf]
Teams should ask their local/regional/super-regional tournament organizers for
details on what Entry leagues (if any) will be running in their region.

[appendix]
[[kicker-power-measuring]]
== Kicker Power Measuring Procedures

All robot kickers will be tested with the tournament ball used in the sub-league they
participate in.
Kicker Power will be measured by means of an on-field test.
The bounce off the walls can change depending on field consturction. Teams
should make sure they can adjust the power of their kicker if necessary.

The test is performed as follows:

.  {~~Place robot inside the goal.~>Place robot inside a goal with the robot touching the back goal wall.~~}
.  Perform a kick into the opposing goal
.  {~~The Open League kicker power test is passed if after bouncing off of the opposite goal
the ball does not return further than the front line of to the penalty area
it was shot from.
The Light Weight League power test is passed if after bouncing off of the opposite goal
the ball does not leave the penalty area of the opposing goal after bouncing back.~>The
kick power test is passed if after bouncing off the opposite goal the ball does not
hit the back wall of the goal the robot performed the kick power test from.~~}
